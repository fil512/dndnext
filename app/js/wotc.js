str : 
"<h4>Strength</h4>\
Strength	measures	bodily	power,	athletic	\
training,	and	the	extent	to	which	you	can	exert	\
raw	physical	force.	You	typically	use	Strength	to	\
climb,	jump,	swim,	strike	a	foe	with	a	melee	\
weapon,	break	down	doors,	lift	gates,	and	burst	\
restraints.\
<br/><br/>\
Any	character	who	fights	in	hand-to-hand	\
combat	can	benefit	from	a	high	Strength	score.	\
Fighters	and	other	warriors,	therefore,	prefer	\
high	Strength	scores.",

dex : 
"<h4>Dexterity</h4>\
Dexterity	measures	your	character's	physical \
agility,	reflexes,	balance,	and	poise.	You	typically	\
use	Dexterity	to	perform	an	acrobatic	action,	\
such	as	maintaining	balance	while	moving	across	\
a	precarious	surface,	contorting	your	body	to	get	\
through	a	tight	space,	striking	a	distant	foe	using	\
a	projectile,	or	slipping	free	from	bindings.\
<br/><br/>\
Rogues	and	other	characters	who	wear	light	\
armor	prefer	a	high	Dexterity	score,	since	it	\
helps	them	avoid	enemy	attacks.	A	character	\
might	also	use	Dexterity	when	making	attacks	\
with	bows,	slings,	and	other	projectile	weapons.	\
Any	character	who	wants	to	react	to	danger	\
quickly	can	benefit	from	a	high	Dexterity	score.",

con :
"<h4>Constitution</h4>\
Constitution	measures	your	health	and	\
durability.	You	typically	use	Constitution	to	hold	\
your	breath,	do	a	forced	march,	run	a	long	\
distance,	or	perform	a	strenuous	activity	for	a	\
long	period.\
<br/><br/>\
All	characters	benefit	from	having	a	high	\
Constitution	score.",

"int" :
"<h4>Intelligence</h4>\
Intelligence	describes	your	mental	acuity,	your	\
education,	and	your	ability	to	reason,	recall	\
information,	and	employ	logic	to	overcome	\
challenges	and	complications.	You	typically	use	\
Intelligence	to	remember	an	important	fact,	find	\
clues	to	a	puzzle,	or	cast	an	arcane	spell.\
<br/><br/>\
Arcane	magic,	such	as	that	used	by	wizards,	\
often	requires	a	keen	mind	for	its	mastery,	and	\
thus	Intelligence	is	most	important	to	such	\
characters.",

wis :
"<h4>Wisdom</h4>\
Wisdom	reflects	how	attuned	you	are	to	your	\
surroundings,	representing	general	\
perceptiveness,	intuition,	insight,	and	other,	less	\
tangible	senses.	Wisdom	is	also	important	for	\
understanding	divine	edicts	and	expectations.\
<br/><br/>\
Although	Wisdom	is	important	to	all	\
characters	who	want	to	be	alert,	Wisdom	is	\
especially	important	to	clerics	and	druids,	since	\
the	ability	is	crucial	for	channeling	divine	power	\
from	the	gods	and	the	environment.",

cha :
"<h4>Charisma</h4>\
Charisma	measures	your	ability	to	influence	\
others	and	the	strength	of	your	personality.	A	\
high	Charisma	suggests	a	strong	sense	of	\
purpose,	whereas	a	low	Charisma	indicates	a	\
less	self-assured	personality.	Charisma	also	\
determines	how	well	you	lead	those	who	follow	\
you.\
<br/><br/>\
All	characters	benefit	from	a	high	Charisma,	\
especially	those	who	deal	with	nonplayer	\
characters,	such	as	hirelings,	henchmen,	and	\
intelligent	monsters.	Charisma	is	also	important	\
to	spellcasters	who	manipulate	magical	power	\
through	sheer	force	of	will.",

race :
"<h4>Race</h4>\
Every	character	belongs	to	a	race,	a	species	in	\
the	fantasy	world.	The	most	common	player	\
character	races	are	dwarves,	elves,	halflings,	and	\
humans.\
<br/><br/>\
The	race	you	choose	contributes	to	your	\
character's	identity	in	an	important	way,	by	\
establishing	general	appearance	and	natural	\
talents	gained	from	culture	and	ancestry.	Your	\
character's	race	grants	particular	racial	traits,	\
such	as	adjustments	to	ability	scores,	special	\
senses,	talent	with	certain	weapons,	or	the	\
ability	to	use	minor	spells.	These	traits	\
sometimes	dovetail	with	the	capabilities	of\
certain	classes.	For	example,	the	\
racial	traits	of	lightfoot	halflings	make	them	\
exceptional	rogues,	while	high	elves	tend	to	be	\
powerful	wizards.",

dwarf :
"<h4>Dwarf</h4>\
Many	ages	have	passed	since	the	dwarven	\
kingdoms	commanded	the	world.	Their	\
mightiest	strongholds,	delved	into	misty	\
mountains,	have	long	since	fallen	into	shadow's	\
hands.	The	magnificent	walls	now	lie	in	rubble,	\
shattered	by	giants'	boulders	and	invaders'	siege	\
engines.	Where	once	dwarf	miners	tunneled	\
through	rock	and	toiled	at	the	forges,	now	orcs	\
and	goblins	roam.	The	fabulous	riches	for	which	\
they	are	famed	have	been	plundered	by	enemies	\
from	below.	And	yet,	the	dwarves	remain.	They	\
remember	their	ancient	glories.	And	they	crave	\
vengeance	against	the	enemies	who	brought	\
them	low.\
<br/><br/>\
The	world	knows	dwarves	for	their	skill	in	\
battle,	their	ability	to	withstand	physical	and	\
magical	punishment,	and	their	knowledge	of	the	\
earth's	secrets.	They	are	as	renowned	for	their	\
hard	work	as	for	their	ability	to	quaff	large	\
quantities	of	ale.	Their	ancient	and	mysterious	\
kingdoms,	carved	into	the	hearts	of	mountains,	\
are	famed	for	their	marvelous	treasures.",

elf :
"<h4>Elf</h4>\
Elves	are	an	ancient	and	powerful	people,	whose	\
years	are	long	and	whose	passions	run	deep.	\
They	form	tight	communities	in	hidden	forests	\
but	mingle	freely	with	other	humanoids,	always	\
welcome	yet	never	at	home.	Elves	favor	things	of	\
natural	and	simple	beauty	and	are	famed	for	\
their	poetry,	dance,	song,	lore,	and	magical	arts.	\
When	danger	threatens	their	woodland	homes,	\
however,	they	reveal	a	stern	martial	side,	\
demonstrating	skill	with	sword,	bow,	and	battle	\
strategy.",

halfling :
"<h4>Halfling</h4>\
The	diminutive	halflings	survive	in	a	world	full	\
of	larger	creatures	by	avoiding	notice	or,	barring	\
that,	avoiding	offense.	They	appear	harmless	and	\
so	have	managed	to	survive	for	centuries	in	the	\
shadow	of	empires	and	on	the	edges	of	wars	and	\
political	strife.	Some	halflings	live	quiet	and	\
peaceful	lives	in	remote	agricultural	\
communities,	while	others	form	nomadic	bands	\
that	travel	constantly,	lured	by	the	open	road	\
and	the	wide	horizon	to	discover	the	wonders	of	\
new	lands	and	peoples.",

human :
"<h4>Human</h4>\
Short-lived	but	influential	far	beyond	their	years,	\
humans	have	rapidly	spread	across	the	worlds	of	\
D&D.	Most	are	the	descendants	of	pioneers,	\
conquerors,	traders,	travelers,	refugees,	and	\
others	on	the	move.	As	a	result,	human	lands	are	\
home	to	a	mix	of	people—physically,	culturally,	\
religiously,	and	politically	diverse.	Hardy	or	fine,	\
light-skinned	or	dark,	showy	or	austere,	\
primitive	or	civilized,	devout	or	impious,	\
humans	run	the	gamut.",
